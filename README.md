# Lock-Free vs Mutex Queue Benchmark (C++)

A minimal, high-performance comparison between a single-producer single-consumer (SPSC) lock-free queue and a mutex-based queue, with tail-latency (p50 / p99 / p99.9) benchmarking.

This project is intended as a learning + systems showcase for low-latency C++ programming.
